# The_Python_I_know
This repo documents the python tricks that I know and use daily.

To view the ipynb. 
1. Copy the URL (e.g. https://github.com/elim723/The_Python_I_know/blob/master/Python_Basics.ipynb)
2. Go to https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/
3. Paste the URL and hit `Go!`

To interact with the ipynb, you can install jupyter notebook to your computer.
Ipython would work too, just not as nice-looking as jupyter. If you can't install
the software, look for an online platform such as https://cocalc.com. You will
have to download my ipynb file and upload it to the site, but it is pretty
straight forward.
